# What is this?
Repository for Charles's personal website hosted through gh-pages.

It is currently set up through [nguyencharles.com](nguyencharles.com)

## Why is this just straight html+css?
The idea was to create simple website to showcase who Charles is, and what he has to offer for any future engineering positions.

## What is in the next phase?
The next phase would be to recreate this with react with updates to experience.
